# NIS2 Compliance Dashboard

This project is a compliance management system for NIS2, providing a dashboard and tools to help organisations assess and manage cybersecurity compliance.

Project Structure
Backend: Node.js and Express.js handle API requests and interact with the MySQL database.
Frontend: React.js provides the user interface, including registration, login, and compliance assessment forms.
Database: MySQL for storing user data, compliance classifications, and assessment responses.
Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed for both frontend and backend dependencies.
MySQL: Set up MySQL and configure the database connection in backend/db.js.
Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nis2-compliance-dashboard.git
cd nis2-compliance-dashboard

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
# Runs the backend server at http://localhost:5000.

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
# Runs the React frontend at http://localhost:3000.

Inspired Source: Handling Async in React useEffect
Purpose:  Following the recommended structure, async calls are defined as inner functions within `useEffect`, ensuring that the hook itself does not return a promise, which can lead to unexpected bugs in React.
Inspired by the example of using `Bugsnag` for error notification, we structured error handling with `try-catch` blocks to capture and log errors.
